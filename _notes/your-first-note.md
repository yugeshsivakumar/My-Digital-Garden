## Why Choose [[Digital Garden]] Instead of Obsidian Publish?

Obsidian offers an official publishing service called Obsidian Publish, but it comes at a cost of $10 per month. While it provides an easy way to share notes, it may not be the best option for those looking for a free alternative.

### Here's why [[Digital Garden]] is a better choice:

- ✅ **Completely Free** – Unlike Obsidian Publish, [[Digital Garden]] lets you host your notes at no cost using [[GitHub]] and [[Netlify]].
- ✅ **More Customization** – You have full control over the design, layout, and structure of your website.
- ✅ **Open-Source & Flexible** – You can modify and expand it according to your needs.
- ✅ **Automatic Updates** – Every time you push new notes to [[GitHub]], your site updates automatically.

With [[Digital Garden]], you get all the benefits of publishing your notes online without any recurring fees! 🚀
