## Why Choose Digital Garden Instead of Obsidian Publish?

Obsidian offers an official publishing service called **Obsidian Publish**, but it costs **$10 per month**. While it provides an easy way to share notes, it may not be the best option for those looking for a **free alternative**.

### Here's why Digital Garden is a better choice:

✅ **Completely Free** – Unlike Obsidian Publish, Digital Garden lets you host your notes at no cost using GitHub and Vercel.
✅ **More Customization** – You have full control over the design, layout, and structure of your website.
✅ **Open-Source & Flexible** – You can modify and expand it according to your needs.
✅ **Automatic Updates** – Every time you push new notes to GitHub, your site updates automatically.

With **Digital Garden**, you get all the benefits of publishing your notes online without any recurring fees! 🚀

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

**GitHub** is a platform that helps you store and manage your files online. You'll need an account since **Digital Garden** uses GitHub to store notes.

### How to Sign Up for GitHub:

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and click **Sign Up**.
2. Enter a username, email, and password.
3. Complete the verification process and click **Create Account**.

Once your account is ready, you can move to the next step!

## Step 2: Use the Digital Garden Jekyll Template

We will use a pre-built **Jekyll template** to create your website quickly.

### How to Use the Template:

1. Go to this template: 👉 **[Digital Garden Jekyll Template]**
2. Click on **"Use this template"** (top-right corner).
3. Select **Create a new repository**.
4. Name your repository (e.g., `my-digital-garden`).
5. Choose **Public** (so others can access it).
6. Click **Create repository from template**.

Now your **GitHub repo** is ready. Next, we'll download **GitHub Desktop** to manage files easily.

## Step 3: Install GitHub Desktop and Clone the Repo

**GitHub Desktop** helps you download and upload files without using complex commands.

### How to Install GitHub Desktop:

1. Download GitHub Desktop 👉 [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Install and open the app.
3. Sign in using your **GitHub account**.

### Clone the Repository to Your Computer:

1. In **GitHub Desktop**, click **File > Clone Repository**.
2. Select your **Digital Garden repo** (e.g., `my-digital-garden`).
3. Choose a **local folder** to store it.
4. Click **Clone**.

This will download your **Digital Garden files** to your computer. Now, let's deploy it online!

## Step 4: Deploy Your Digital Garden Using Vercel

**Vercel** is a free hosting platform that will turn your notes into a website.

### How to Deploy with Vercel:

1. Go to **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)**.
2. Sign up with **GitHub**.
3. Click **New Project**.
4. Select your **Digital Garden repository** (e.g., `my-digital-garden`).
5. Click **Import**.
6. Click **Deploy** and wait for a few minutes.

Once done, Vercel will give you a website link (e.g., `https://mydigitalgarden.vercel.app`). 🎉

## Step 5: Add Your Obsidian Notes to the Digital Garden

Now, we'll move your **Obsidian notes** to the Digital Garden folder.

### Copy Notes to the Right Folder:

1. Open the **GitHub Desktop folder** where you downloaded `my-digital-garden`.
2. Inside the folder, find `_notes/`.
3. Copy your **Obsidian Markdown files** (`.md` files) or folder into this `_notes` folder.

✅ Your notes are now inside the Digital Garden!

## Step 6: Push the Changes to GitHub

After adding notes, we need to upload them to **GitHub** so they appear on the website.

### How to Push Notes Using GitHub Desktop:

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.
2. You will see the new files listed as **"Uncommitted changes"**.
3. In the bottom-left, type a message like **"Added new notes"**.
4. Click **Commit to main**.
5. Click **Push to origin** to upload the changes.

After a few minutes, your **notes will appear** on your website! 🎉

## Step 7: View Your Published Notes

1. Go to your **Vercel website link** (e.g., `https://mydigitalgarden.vercel.app`).
2. Click on your **first note**.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see a **graph view** of all your notes.

🧠 This allows you to **visually navigate** your notes and explore their connections! 🚀

## Step 8: Customize Your Homepage

By default, your homepage shows a **list of notes**. You can customize it!

### How to Edit Your Homepage:

1. Go to your **GitHub Desktop folder** (`my-digital-garden`).
2. Open the folder: `/digital-garden/_pages/index.md`
3. Edit `index.md` using **Notepad** or **Obsidian**.
4. Change the text to customize your homepage.
5. Save the file and **push the changes** to GitHub.

✅ Your website will update automatically! 🎨

2. Go to **Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Domains**.
3. Click **Add Domain** and enter your new domain.
