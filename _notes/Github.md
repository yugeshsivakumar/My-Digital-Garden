# GitHub: A Comprehensive Overview

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a **web-based platform** for **version control** and **collaboration**, built on **Git**. It allows developers to work on projects together, track changes, and manage code efficiently.

## Key Features

### 1. **Repositories (Repos)**

- A repository stores all project files, including code, documentation, and other assets.

### 2. **Branches**

- Developers create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project.
- Common branches:
  - `main` (or `master`) – The main branch of the project.
  - Feature branches – Created for new functionalities.
  - Bugfix branches – Created to fix specific issues.

### 3. **Pull Requests (PRs)**

- PRs are used to propose changes from one branch to another.
- Other developers can **review, comment, and approve** before merging changes.

### 4. **Issues**

- Used to **track bugs, feature requests, and discussions** related to a project.
- Can be assigned labels, milestones, and assignees.

### 5. **Actions (CI/CD)**

- GitHub Actions allow automation for testing, deployment, and other workflows.

### 6. **GitHub Pages**

- Host static websites directly from a repository using **GitHub Pages**.

### 7. **Security Features**

- **Code scanning** to detect vulnerabilities.
- **Dependabot** alerts for outdated dependencies.

## Why Use GitHub?

- **Collaboration**: Work with developers across the world.
- **Version Control**: Keep track of changes and roll back when needed.
